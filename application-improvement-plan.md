# TrendyBets Application Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for optimizing data retrieval and enhancing the TrendyBets application. We'll focus on performance improvements, user experience enhancements, and new features that can be implemented to make the application more robust and user-friendly.

## 1. Data Retrieval Optimization

### 1.1 Database Query Optimization

- [ ] **1.1.1 Implement query caching**

  - Implement cache invalidation strategies for data that changes frequently

- [x] **1.1.2 Optimize Supabase queries**
  - [x] Review and add appropriate indexes to frequently queried columns
  - [x] Use `.select()` with specific columns instead of `*` to reduce data transfer
  - [x] Implement pagination for large result sets (e.g., player history)
  - [x] Add query execution time logging for performance monitoring

- [ ] **1.1.3 Implement database connection pooling**
  - Configure connection pooling for Supabase client
  - Optimize connection reuse across API routes

### 1.2 API Data Fetching Optimization

- [ ] **1.2.1 Implement request batching**
  - Consolidate multiple API requests into batched requests where possible
  - Reduce the number of separate API calls in components

- [x] **1.2.2 Add API response caching**
  - [x] Implement server-side caching for external API responses
  - [x] Use stale-while-revalidate pattern for UI data
  - [x] Configure appropriate cache headers for API routes

- [x] **1.2.3 Optimize parallel data fetching**
  - [x] Review and improve Promise.all usage for concurrent requests
  - [x] Implement request prioritization for critical data

### 1.3 Data Synchronization Improvements

- [ ] **1.3.1 Implement incremental sync**
  - Only fetch and update data that has changed since last sync
  - Use timestamps or etags to track data freshness

- [ ] **1.3.2 Optimize sync scheduling**
  - Implement intelligent scheduling based on data update frequency
